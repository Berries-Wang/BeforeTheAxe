# include_directories
&nbsp;&nbsp;Add include directories to the build.
```txt
    include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 [dir2 ...])
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;Add the given directories to those the compiler uses to search for include files. Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the current source directory.(将给定的目录添加到编译器用来搜索包含文件的目录中。相对路径被解释为相对于当前源目录。)

&nbsp;&nbsp;The include directories are added to the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES directory property for the current CMakeLists file. They are also added to the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property for each target in the current CMakeLists file. The target property values are the ones used by the generators.(包含目录被添加到当前CMakeLists文件的INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES目录属性中。它们也被添加到当前CMakeLists文件中每个目标的INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES目标属性中。目标属性值是生成器使用的值。)

&nbsp;&nbsp;By default the directories specified are appended onto the current list of directories. This default behavior can be changed by setting CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE to ON. By using AFTER or BEFORE explicitly, you can select between appending and prepending, independent of the default.(默认情况下，指定的目录被附加到当前目录列表中。这个默认行为可以通过将cmake_include_directores_before设置为ON来改变。通过显式地使用AFTER或BEFORE，您可以在附加和前置之间进行选择，而不依赖于默认值。)

&nbsp;&nbsp;If the SYSTEM option is given, the compiler will be told the directories are meant as system include directories on some platforms. Signaling this setting might achieve effects such as the compiler skipping warnings, or these fixed-install system files not being considered in dependency calculations - see compiler docs.(如果给出了SYSTEM选项，编译器将被告知这些目录是某些平台上的系统包含目录。通知此设置可能会导致编译器跳过警告，或者这些固定安装的系统文件在依赖项计算中不被考虑-请参阅编译器文档。)


&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguments to include_directories may use generator expressions with the syntax \$\<...\>. See the cmake-generator-expressions(7) manual for available expressions. See the cmake-buildsystem(7) manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.(include_directories的参数可以使用语法为\$\<…\>的生成器表达式。有关可用的表达式，请参阅cmake-generator-expressions(7)手册。有关定义buildsystem属性的更多信息，请参阅cmake-buildsystem(7)手册。)

## 使用示例
```cmake
  include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/device_libs ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/STM32_Driver ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/headers)
```
